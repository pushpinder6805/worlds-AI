    <h1>Inworld AI Community Guidelines</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>At Inworld AI, we're building the future of conversational AI together. We believe that great technology comes from great communities. We're committed to fostering an inclusive, collaborative, and respectful environment where developers, creators, and AI enthusiasts can learn, share, and innovate together. To make this possible, we ask all community members to engage with professionalism and mutual respect.</p>

    <p>These Community Guidelines apply to all participants, contributors, visitors, partners, moderators, vendors, event organizers, and administrators ("Participants") in any Inworld AI community environment, including our forums, GitHub discussions, social media channels, live streams, workshops, conferences, hackathons, and any other platforms or events where our community gathers ("Community Channels"). All Participants must follow these Guidelines, which will be enforced consistently across all Community Channels.</p>

    <h2>Building a Positive Community</h2>
    <p>We ask that all Participants contribute to creating an open, welcoming, inclusive, and constructive environment by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Treating others with respect:</strong> Value different opinions, perspectives, and approaches. Disagreement is natural and healthy, but it should always be expressed respectfully.</li>
      <li><strong>Demonstrating empathy and kindness:</strong> Approach all interactions with understanding and assume good intentions from fellow Participants.</li>
      <li><strong>Communicating professionally:</strong> Use language and conduct appropriate for a diverse, global audience. Keep discussions polite, nonjudgmental, and constructive.</li>
      <li><strong>Honoring our terms and policies:</strong> Follow all applicable Inworld AI terms of service, platform-specific guidelines, and applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Behavior We Don't Tolerate</h2>
    <p>We do not accept any behavior that would reasonably cause any Participant to feel unsafe, insecure, or threatened in their physical, mental, or emotional well-being. Unacceptable conduct includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Illegal activity</li>
      <li>Harassment, abuse, discriminatory or offensive remarks</li>
      <li>Sexual misconduct or use of sexualized language or imagery</li>
      <li>Data harvesting or collecting personal data without consent</li>
      <li>Automated abuse using bots or scrapers</li>
      <li>Impersonation or misrepresentation</li>
      <li>Security violations or circumvention of access controls</li>
      <li>Other inappropriate conduct in professional settings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All Participants are responsible for their own actions. Consent and permission can be revoked at any time. Once revoked, continuing interaction is not acceptable.</p>

    <h2>Content Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not share private or confidential information without permission.</li>
      <li>Do not violate intellectual property or legal rights.</li>
      <li>Do not distribute malicious or harmful content.</li>
      <li>Do not engage in excessive self-promotion or spam.</li>
      <li>Do not disrupt discussions or post repetitive off-topic content.</li>
      <li>Participants must be at least 16 years of age.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Moderation and Enforcement</h2>
    <p>Inworld AI Moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards. They may remove or edit content that violates these Guidelines. We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of identity, background, or beliefs.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Warnings</li>
      <li>Temporary suspension</li>
      <li>Permanent removal from channels</li>
      <li>Revocation of access or privileges</li>
      <li>Referral to law enforcement if necessary</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reporting Violations</h2>
    <p>If you are being harassed or notice misconduct, report it immediately:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email: <a href="mailto:community@inworld.ai">community@inworld.ai</a></li>
      <li>In-platform reporting: Use the flag or report function in Community Channels</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All reports will be reviewed promptly, thoroughly, and fairly, respecting the rights of all Participants.</p>

    <h2>Consequences for Violations</h2>

      <li>Immediate removal from community channels</li>
      <li>Account suspension or termination</li>
      <li>Ban from future Inworld AI events</li>
      <li>Other actions deemed necessary</li>
    </ul>
